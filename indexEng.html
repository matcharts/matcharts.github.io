                <p id="desc">
           In 2021, Mat officially landed his first role as a DJ. Since then, he has had the opportunity to work with several major industry players, such as the SAT, L’Abreuvoir, Café Campus, the Old Port of Montreal Corporation, and many others, as well as at multiple weddings, private parties, and corporate events. He is also a music producer, which allows him to refine related skills and expand his musical horizons.

                    Mat Charts was born from a simple idea: to share the music and atmosphere that he loves experiencing as an event guest. With that in mind, he has made it his goal to find the place where the genres I enjoy in listening to blend with those that move the dancefloor.

                    Over the course of his contracts, he has learned to mix various styles, from Hip-Hop, Reggaeton, and R&B to Y2K and Dance music, though his primary focus remains House and sub genres. His music selection is his pride and joy. He updates his playlists first and foremost as a fan, ensuring he maintains a high-quality library tailored to his audience.

                    What sets him apart is his ability to layer elements to create unique sounds—ones that feel fresh yet instantly recognizable. The emphasis is thorough preparation, carefully curating a mix of tracks and artists that resonate with today’s listeners while combining them in innovative ways. This makes him very adaptable : he is comfortable with a variety of events, crowds and ambiances.
